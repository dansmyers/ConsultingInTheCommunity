# Information Literacy Assignment

## Summary

We're going to build a collaborative bibliography of papers and their summaries related to community development. These papers will be a resource for your own white papers as well as for future versions of this class.

You're going to identify **four** papers related to one of the themes described in the next section, then prepare a one paragraph summary of each one. Your summaries should cover (in four to six sentences) the main idea of the paper, the methods or data that it draws upon, and the key results.

In addition to completing the one paragraph summary, include a second short (one to three sentence) statement describing how you located each paper and the criteria that you used to identify it as a useful resource.

## Themes

Select one of the eight following themes as the subject for your literature review. Each member of a team should choose a different topic (but the same topic may be selected by multiple people if they're on different teams):

- The Community Capitals Framework or other frameworks for assessing community development
- Psychological safety and its role in team building
- Social capital (bridging and bonding)
- Evaluating community development projects
- Ripple effect mapping
- The role of strategic planning in community development
- Social impact measurement
- Lean social enterprises


## Format

Put your four summaries into a single document. For each paper, include

1. A citation in APA format. This must include the author(s), title, year, and publication venue.
2. Your four to six sentence summary of the most important details of the paper. Write these so that another person can understand the most important points of each paper without having to read it.
3. A few additional sentences summarizing how you found and evaluated the paper as suitable for your topic.


## Submission
