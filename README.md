## Official Course Description

This capstone course gives you the opportunity to complete a significant research project in partnership with a community organization. Using a methdology called
Ripple Effect Mapping, we'll be investigating the impacts of community programs and providing advice to our partners on their work, strategy, and messaging. In
addition to conducting your study and preparing a white paper summarizing your findings, we'll also learn more about community development, entrepreneurship, and revisit important ideas from the liberal arts that have come up in your previous Rollins classes.

## Learning Outcomes


## Textbook

There is no official textbook. I'll provide you with some relevant readings during the semester and you'll conduct a literature review for your own project.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

The grading system for this class is simple: **Do all of the required work (described in more detail below) and you get an A**. That's it. If you fail to complete some items, your grade will be reduced to something less than an A.

### Ripple Effect Mapping

The centerpiece of this course is an impact assessment project that you'll complete in partnership with a community organization. The ultimate goal and scope of your study will be determined early in the semester through conversations with your partner, but it will focus on documenting the impact of one of the organizations' programs.

We will have about three teams of five or six people, each team working with one community partner.

All of our projects will use a methodology called **Ripple Effect Mapping (REM)**, a method of program evaluation that engages community stakeholders to collaboratively map a program's history and impact. REM was originally developed in agricultural extension work to investigate the impact of interventions on entire communities, particularly second order qualitative outcomes that can't be easily captured by quantitative measures.

An REM session works like an extended think-pair-share discussion activity and takes two to three hours to complete. The process has three basic steps.

1. Partcipants free-write individual responses to a short prompt. This first step is intentionally open and intended to stimulate reflection (10-15 minutes)

2. Partcipants group into pairs and engage each other in structured interviews, using questions guides provided by the facilitators. The interview questions focus on collecting specific stories about the program (30 minutes).

3. The final and longest part is a full-group collaborative mind-mapping activity. The facilitators prompt the participants to share thoughts and experiences that emerged during their reflections and interviews. As themes emerge, the facilitators draw out a mind map on a large piece of paper at the front of the room.

The complete data set from the REM session consists of the mind map, written responses, and transcription of the participants comments during the discussion. The research team then mines the data for important themes.

### Projects

You will work with your team to complete two Ripple Effect Mapping projects.

1. A short warm-up project done to assess the impact of a program or group on campus. The goal of this project is to become familiar with the mechanics and logistical details of REM before you do the larger study with your partner. This project will be completed between late January and mid February.

2. The major REM project with your partner. Your data collection session for this project will take place between late February and mid March, before Spring Break. Once you have the data, you will spend the second part of the semester analyzing it and preparing a white paper (following guidelines I will give you) to present your findings back to the partner.

You will also complete three additional assignments:

- An annotated bibliography summarizing other work related to your REM project.
- A short critical thinking paper, requiring your to read and evaluate an article.
- An short in-class integrative learning activity.

### Satisfactory Credit

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. "Satisfactory" means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

### The Grading Contract

Satisfactory completion of all the following items earns a grade of A for the course. Each item that you fail to complete will reduce your final grade by one letter.

1. Team collaboration contract, completed at the beginning of the semester.

2. Develop a plan for your first, small scale REM study. This includes identifying the campus group or program that you propose to study, preparing the interview guides and written questions, and recruiting participants.

3. Conduct the data collection session for your campus REM study.

4. Analyze the results from your campus study and produce a brief write-up summarizing your findings. We'll talk about the analysis and write-up process in class.

5. Meet with your community partner and identify the scope and target participants for your study.

6. Prepare materials for the main REM session, including interview guides, recruitment e-mails, etc.

7. Partcipate in the REM data collection session with your community partner. **THIS IS MANDATORY**. Once you schedule a time for the session, you **must commit** to attending, barring a serious dire emergency. Please note that other classes, work obligations, and sports are not acceptable conflicts. If you become ill you can only be excused with a doctor's note or a positive COVID test taken within 24 hours of the session.

8. Transcribe the audio recording of your data collection session.

9. Conduct a thematic analysis of your data. We'll go over the process for doing this in class.

10. Prepare a satisfactory white paper using the template and guidelines I will give you to report your results back to the community partner.

11. Complete the additional assignments: the annotated bibliography, the criticial thinking activity, and the in-class integrative learning questionnaire.

**Plus and minus grades** are awarded for work that falls between two of the contract levels. For example, if you do more than the required work for a C, but not quite enough to earn a full B, you could receive either a C+ or B- depending on how close you are to the full B standard.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

4. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

5. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### I Feel Decidedly Uncomfortable

This is probably a new approach to grading for you. In particular, students new to specs grading often have anxiety about the lack of partial credit in the system.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **You don't have to be perfect**. The "substantially complete and correct" standard allows for imperfections in your answers and you only need 90% of the available question points over the semester, so you don't have to correctly answer, or even attempt, every programming problem or quiz question.

2. **You *do* need to be consistent**. The system rewards you for putting forward good, consistent effort. Working diligently and carefully will allow you to accumulate all of the points that you need for a B.

3. **You will get lots of feedback**. The project specifications will tell you, unambiguously, whether your answers for a programming question are correct or not. The standards for the final project and the reading questions will likewise be transparent.

4. **Some work will be done in class**. Most of the final project will be done during the last few class meetings.

## COVID Policies

The College's COVID-19 prevention policies will apply to all of our class meetings. We'll wear masks and sit in assigned seats for the duration of the semester.

## Other Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet. **Don't attend class if you're sick**.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.

It is acceptable to discuss questions and solutions in general terms with other class members, but your discussions should not be at a level of detail that would lead to you submitting the same work as a another student.

environment	that	does	not	discriminate	against	persons	with	disabilities.	It	is	the	
spirit	of	these	laws	that guides	the	college	toward	expanding	access	in	all	courses	
and	programs,	utilizing	innovative	instructional	design,	and	identifying	and	
removing	barriers	whenever	possible.

If	you	are	a	person	with	a	disability	and	anticipate	needing	any	type	of	academic	
accommodations	in	order	to	fully	participate	in	your	classes,	please	contact	the	
Office	of	Accessibility	Services,	located	on	the	first	floor	of	the	Olin	Library,	as	soon	
as	possible. You	are	encouraged	to	schedule	a	Welcome	Meeting	by	filling	out	
the “First	Time	Users” form	on	the	website: https://www.rollins.edu/accessibilityservices and/or	reach	out	by	phone	or	email: 407-975-6463 or Access@Rollins.edu.

All	test-taking	accommodations	requested	for	this	course	must	first	be	approved	
through	the	Office	of	Accessibility	Services (OAS)	and	scheduled	online	through	
Accommodate at	least	72	hours	before	the	exam.	Official	accommodation	letters	
must	be	received	by	and	discussed	with	the	faculty	in	advance.	 There	will	be	no	
exceptions	given	unless	previously	approved	by	the	OAS with	documentation	of	the	
emergency	situation.	We	highly	recommend	making	all	testing	accommodations	at	
the	beginning	of	the	semester.	OAS staff	are	available	to	assist	with	this	process.

### Citation	Expectations
As	per	the	Academic	Honor	Code,	plagiarism	is	defined	as	“Offering the words, facts,
or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise.” In	order	to	avoid	
plagiarism,	all	students	are	expected	to	use	proper	citation	norms.	For	our	course,	
all	assignments	will	use	[faculty	choice	- MLA,	Chicago,	APA,	etc]	citation	style.	

### Absences	– Religious	Holidays	and/or	Campus	Business
The	professor	will	accommodate	a	reasonable	number	of	excused	absences	for	
religious	holidays	and	official	off-campus	college	business	such	as	academic	
conference	presentations	and	athletic	competitions.	However,	per	the	College’s	
policy	on	excused	absences	
(http://www.rollins.edu/catalogue/academic_regulations.html#class-attendance),	
students	must	discuss	with	the	professor	the	dates	of	the	anticipated	absences	no	
later	than	the	last	day	of	the	drop	period.	Students	must	present	to	their	professor	
written	evidence	of	the	anticipated	absences	and	discuss	with	him/her	how	and	
when	make-up	work	should	be	completed	prior	to	missing	the	class.	Students	
should	not	expect	to	receive	allowance	for	excused	absences	if	they	do	not	meet	
with	the	professor	beforehand	and	clarify	the	dates	as	necessary.	Absences	will	be	
addressed	by	the	faculty	member	in	accordance	with	his/her	attendance	policy.	The	
professor	retains	the	right	to	determine	what	would	be	considered	to	be	a	
reasonable	number	of	absences	(excused	or	otherwise)	for	the	course.	A	student	
will	not	fail	a	course	because	the	number	of	religious	observances	and/or	college	
business	absences	exceed	the	number	of	absences	allowed,	except	if	excessive	
absences	make	it	impossible	to	fulfill	the	expectations	of	the	course.	The	student’s	
class	participation	grade	in	the	course,	though,	may	still	be	affected.

### Credit	Hour	Statement	for	Rollins	Courses
This	course	is	a	four-credit-hour	course	that	meets	three	hours	per	week.	The	value	
of four	credit	hours	results,	in	part,	from	work	expected	of	enrolled	students	both	
inside	and	outside	the	classroom. Rollins	faculty	require	that	students	average	at	
least	2	½	hours	of	outside	work	for	every	hour	of	scheduled	class	time. In	this	
course,	the	additional	outside-of-class	expectations	are	reading and substantial programming projects
in our online programming environment.

### Recording	Device Use
In	order	to	protect	the	integrity	of	the	classroom	experience,	the	use	of	recording	
devices	is	limited	to	either	the	expressed	permission	of	the	faculty	member	or	with	
proper	documentation	from	the	Office	of	Accessibility	Services. Information	about	
accommodations	through	Accessibility	Services	can	be	found	at
